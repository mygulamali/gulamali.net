### Meaning and Behaviour in Grid Oriented Components
*Anthony Mayer, Stephen McGough, Murtaza Gulamali, Laurie Young, Jim Stanton,

The ICENI middleware utilises information captured within a component based
application in order to facilitate Grid-based scheduling. We describe a system
of application related meta-data that features a separation of concerns
between meaning, behaviour and implementation, which allows for both
communication and implementation selection at run-time, while providing the
user with a flow-based programming model. It is shown that this separation
enables a flexible approach to scheduling, and eases the integration of
components with disparate control flow patterns or data types, by means of
converters and tees for collective communication. By explicitly recording
application information and supporting multiple scheduling approaches,
communication protocols and component applications, while retaining OGSA
compatibility, the ICENI component model is ideally suited to Grid computing.
