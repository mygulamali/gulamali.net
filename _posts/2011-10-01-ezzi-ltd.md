[Ezzi Ltd](http://www.ezzibiz.net/) offers numerous ICT services to small and
medium sized businesses, as well as household customers. Theyâ€™ve had an online
presence since 2005 but their website had been in dire need of a refresh. I
developed and deployed a new website for them, using
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) as a content management system, and
incorporating [HTML5](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/) and a modern [responsive
design](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/) so that it
looks great on any platform.
