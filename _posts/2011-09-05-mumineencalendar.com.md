This is a bit of a personal project. As a [Dawoodi Bohra
Muslim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawoodi_bohra) I follow the
[Hijri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar) (Islamic) calendar as
well as the normal,
[Gregorian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar), calendar. Since
both are based on different cycles (the Lunar cycle and the Solar cycle,
respectively) it can be difficult to track events in either calendar in a
coherent way. Our [local Dawoodi Bohra community](http://londonjamaat.org/)
annually distributes a hardcopy version of a calendar featuring the dates from
both the Hijri and Gregorian calendars, and also there are
[salaat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah) mobile apps and local community
websites which do a similar thing.  But on the whole I haven’t found anything
that I like.

I wanted something that,
* could show both the Hijri and Gregorian calendars for any time since these
* calendars began, was flexible enough to show salaat times for anywhere in
* the world, was attractive, interactive and easy to use in a Web 2.0 kind of
* way, and, was available to view or use on any platform.

But I also wanted to learn [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). And so I
developed the [Mumineen Calendar](http://mumineencalendar.com/) web
application, and am continuing to work on it as I receive feedback and
suggestions from friends, family and other Dawoodi Bohra’s.
