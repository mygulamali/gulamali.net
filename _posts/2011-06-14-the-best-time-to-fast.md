Aziz recently wrote [a post about fasting in Rajab al-Asab][1], the 7th month
in the [Islamic calendar][2]. He quoted [Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq][3] (SA) about
the virtues of roza (fasting) in Rajab for 10 consecutive years. Here in the
Northern latitudes (i.e. London) this can be a difficult feat, especially
during those years when Rajab falls during the long summer months, leading to
fasts of over 18 hours!

So when is the best time to begin your 10 consecutive years of fasting in
Rajab? Well, according to my graph above, it has to be in about 12 years
times, in 1444H, when the 10 years of Rajab fall in the short winter months
(highlighted by the green block).

Of course, I’ll be 50-something by then, so I still won’t be looking forward to it.
