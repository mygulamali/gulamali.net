It's been way too long since my last post, so let's try this blogging malarky
again&hellip;

Aside from the (new?) [Web 1.0][1] based theme, the main changes to this site
since my last post include hosting on my [Dreamhost][2] account instead of
[GitHub Pages][3], and using a combination of [SASS][4], [Bourbon][5] and
[Neat][6] to style all the things instead of [Bootstrap][7].  The entire site
is still version controlled via [GitHub][8] so feel free to have a gander at
the cogs and springs.

The decision to host this site on [Dreamhost][2] instead of [GitHub Pages][3]
came about as I already have an active [Dreamhost][2] account.  And whilst
it's Ã¼ber cool that [GitHub Pages][3] freely hosts your site and lets you
republish it by simply performing a `git push`, I found that setting up the
custom URL and DNS to point to `gulamali.net` rendered most of my subdomains
invalid.  Doh!  Also, by self-hosting this site I can use my own
[Jekyll plugins][9].  For reference, I use the `rake` strategy
[outlined by Tate Johnson][10] (amongst others) to `rsync` the static site
generated by [Jekyll][11] to my [Dreamhost][2] account.

I decided to move away from [Bootstrap][7] because I feel it has become a
little bit bloated (nearly 500k for the unzipped distribution, really?) and
nearly every other website looks like a [Bootstrap][7] website.  There are
plenty of other good stylesheet frameworks available (eg. [Pure][12],
[Foundation][13], etc.) but I decided to forego these and use [Bourbon][5] and
[Neat][6] because they are purely [SASS][4] frameworks, resulting in cleaner
CSS.  I definitely need to read [David Kadavy's book][14] to improve my
design-fu, but that's a good thing, right?

So, I'm not going to make any promises or resolutions (8 days into 2014 and
I've already broken a few) but hopefully the changes above will result in more
frequent blog posts from yours truly.  Only time will tell.

Oh, and [SASS][4]!  Yay! **;)**
