Hamid Trading primarily deals in the buying and selling of foreign exchange
([FOREX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market))
currencies. They wanted to test one of their mechanical trading strategies in
order to assess its viability, as well as optimise it for the best
performance. I was able to develop a web based application to meet their
requirements and give them an insight into their trading strategy. In
particular, the application is fast (each execution can crunch several years
of financial data in a few seconds), flexible (it can easily be modified to
take different currencies or performance metrics into account) and delivers
results in an straightforward way (using the [Google Visualization
API](http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/interactive_charts.html)),
ready for offline analysis.
