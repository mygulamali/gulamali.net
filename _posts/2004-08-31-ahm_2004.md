Initial work in the Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system model (GENIE) project
involved a series of parameter sweep experiments using a Grid infrastructure
consisting of a flcked Condor pool, a webservice oriented data management
system and a web portal. In this paper we introduce the Imperial College
E-Science Networked Infrastructure (ICENI) Grid middleware, and describe how
it can be used to increase the eficiency of GENIE parameter sweep
experiments. We perform several experiments using a combination of different
computational resources and different job deployment mechanisms. Our results
suggest that ICENI does not produce any signifcant overhead in the sojourn
time of a GENIE parameter sweep experiment and can promote the sharing of
computational resources between institutions.
