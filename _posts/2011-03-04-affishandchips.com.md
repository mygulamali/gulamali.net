[AF Fish and Chips](http://www.affishandchips.com/) provide *Halaal* fish to
the [Dawoodi Bohra community](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawoodi_bohra) in
the UK. They wanted to consolidate their presence on the internet and provide
an avenue of information for customers, old and new. I designed, developed and
deployed a website for them to market their company, integrating it with a
mailing list and social media bookmarks.
