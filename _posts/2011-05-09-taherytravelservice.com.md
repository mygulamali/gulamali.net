[Tahery Travel Service](http://www.taherytravelservice.com/) offers visa and
passport services to travellers, removing the need of having to personally
visit a foreign embassy or consulate.  They wanted to expand their business
online as well as provide a single place for customers to find concise and
current information about travel requirements.  I set them up with an online
presence including a [Google
Apps](http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/index.html) account, a
website employing [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) as a
[CMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system), [Google
Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to measure performance, and
[Google AdWords](http://adwords.google.co.uk/) to market their services.
