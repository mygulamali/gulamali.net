<p>Initial work in the Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system model (GENIE)
project involved a series of parameter sweep experiments using a Grid
infrastructure consisting of a flcked Condor pool, a webservice oriented data
management system and a web portal. In this paper we introduce the Imperial
College E-Science Networked Infrastructure (ICENI) Grid middleware, and describe
how it can be used to increase the eficiency of GENIE parameter sweep
experiments. We perform several experiments using a combination of different
computational resources and different job deployment mechanisms. Our results
suggest that ICENI does not produce any signifcant overhead in the sojourn time
of a GENIE parameter sweep experiment and can promote the sharing of
computational resources between institutions.</p>
