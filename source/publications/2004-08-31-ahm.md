#### Abstract

Initial work in the Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system model (GENIE) project
involved a series of parameter sweep experiments using a Grid infrastructure
consisting of a flocked Condor pool, a webservice oriented data management
system and a web portal. In this paper we introduce the Imperial College
E-Science Networked Infrastructure (ICENI) Grid middleware, and describe how it
can be used to increase the efficiency of GENIE parameter sweep experiments. We
perform several experiments using a combination of different computational
resources and different job deployment mechanisms. Our results suggest that
ICENI does not produce any significant overhead in the sojourn time of a GENIE
parameter sweep experiment and can promote the sharing of computational
resources between institutions.
